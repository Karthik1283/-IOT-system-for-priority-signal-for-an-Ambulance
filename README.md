# -IOT-system-for-priority-signal-for-an-Ambulance

Our team was motivated to develop a more reliable and efficient way to clear traffic for emergency vehicles. By using lot technology to detect the presence of an ambulance and signal traffic lights to turn red on other sides of the intersection, our system can provide a clear path for emergency vehicles to reach their destination quickly and safely. This system has the potential to reduce response times for emergency medical services, improve patient outcomes, and save lives.
